# Shortest paths:
### Bellman Ford: given a start node in the Graphs, computes the shortest paths to every other node.
Works on the list of edges, in O(N*V) time complexity.

### Dijkstra: Computes the shortest paths from a start node to all other nodes in the graph.
* works on adjMatrix. Given a start node, it expands it with the cheapest neighbour. then do the same for all nodes.

### Maximum Flow
