/**
 * There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].
 * You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to
 * its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 *
 * Given two integer arrays gas[] and cost[], return the starting gas station's index if you can travel
 * around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
 * If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique
